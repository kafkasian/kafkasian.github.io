<p><b>Hello!</b> </p>

<div class="columntxt">
<p>This is a blogue under construction. Yet, being under construction doesn't necessarily mean that there are tens of people working on it. It is just me. I am using this very simple and basic style for the blog because I want it to be a simple website/blog. This text currently serves as a "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" kind of text. In other words, it mainly serves as a sample text for me to see the effects of the styling, etc.
</p>

<div>
     <p class="small">
	This is the footer section but I might change the text size to this one in general. Here comes the lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. And then there is also the other lorem ipsum dolor amet. But in general one could argue that all lorem ipsum dolor sit amet are simply lorem ipsum dolor sit amets. Am I right?</p>
